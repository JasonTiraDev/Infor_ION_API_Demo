    Welcome to a demo application on how to access the Infor ION API
</MudText>
<br/>
<MudText>
    This application is a Blazor WebAssembly application that uses the Infor ION API to retrieve data from Infor ION.
    The main goal is simply to demonstrate the how, as that was my struggle.
    I will do my best to make sure the code is commented and explain what it is doing.
